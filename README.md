# FreezeTagVexNet
A freeze tag game for vexnet robots 
This code is designed for robots using 3 wire motors and a button on the back of the robot.
When driving around the bot using the controller, the goal is to hit other VexBot's button. When the button is pressed you lose control of the bot and the bot freezes 
in place. 
When a teamate presses your button after you've been frozen, you will regain control of the robot.
The robot in question has a 3rd motor that controls a robotic arm, arm is not required but is recommended as it can extend your reach.

*Sorry if the code looks ugly, me and some friends were having a competition to see who could complete the task(coding the Freeze tag thing) using the fewest lines of
of code*
